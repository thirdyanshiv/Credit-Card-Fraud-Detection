# Credit Card Fraud Detection
# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The goal is to build a classification model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

# Libraries:

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models and evaluation)
